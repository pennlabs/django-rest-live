        This method initializes a view properly so that calls to methods like get_queryset() and get_serializer_class(),
        and permission checks have all the properties set, like self.kwargs and self.request, that they would expect.

        The production of a Django HttpRequest object from a base websocket asgi scope, rather than an actual HTTP
        request, is probably the largest "hack" in this project. By inspection of the ASGI spec, however,
        the only difference between websocket and HTTP scopes is the existence of an HTTP method
        (https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specs/www.html).

        This is because websocket connections are established over an HTTP connection, and so headers and everything
        else are set just as they would be in a normal HTTP request. Therefore, the base of the request object for
        every broadcast is the initial HTTP request. Subscriptions are retrieval operations, so the method is hard-coded
        as GET.
