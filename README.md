`django-rest-live` adds real-time subscriptions over websockets to
[Django REST Framework](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework) views by leveraging websocket support provided 
by [Django Channels](https://github.com/django/channels).

The goal of this project is to be as close to a drop-in realtime solution as possible for projects already using
Django REST Framework.

The only change to your existing code is dropping in a mixin to the REST Framework view that
you want to make realtime-capable:

```python
from rest_framework.viewsets import ModelViewSet
from rest_live.mixins import RealtimeMixin

class TaskViewSet(ModelViewSet, RealtimeMixin): # The only change is adding the RealtimeMixin!
    queryset = Task.objects.all()
    serializer_class = TaskSerializer
```

There's a few more lines needed to set up routing with Django Channels, and you can go

`django-rest-live` took initial inspiration from [this article by Kit La Touche](https://www.oddbird.net/2018/12/12/channels-and-drf/).
Differently from projects like [`djangochannelsrestframework`](https://github.com/hishnash/djangochannelsrestframework),
`django-rest-live` does not aim to supplant REST Framework for performing CRUD actions through a REST API. Instead,
it is designed to be used in conjunction with HTTP REST endpoints. Clients should still use normal REST framework
endpoints generated by ViewSets and other API views to get initial data to populate a page, as well as any write-driven
behavior (`POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, `DELETE`). `django-rest-live` gets rid of the need for periodic polling GET
requests to for resource updates after page load.
